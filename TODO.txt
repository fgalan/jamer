Some things that could be done in the future:

* User Criteria API for queries instead of named queries. Check metamodel in JPA
  (http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/jpamodelgen/reference/en-US/html_single/)
* Add entity contraints
  - Ensure that the combination companyName-feedName is globally unique, e.g.:

    @Entity
    @Table(
    uniqueConstraints = { @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = { "name", "company_id" }) })

  - Ensure that the combination feed-user is unique, e.g.:

    @Entity
    @Table(
    uniqueConstraints = { @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = { "feed_id", "user_id" }) })

  - Ensure that the combination post-user is unique, e.g.:

    @Entity
    @Table(
    uniqueConstraints = { @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = { "post_id", "user_id" }) })

* Improvements in the REST controller
  - Proper return of HTTP response codes (200, 4xx, etc.)
  - JSON/XML payload processing in POST procesing
  - DELETE methods, taking into account logic level deletion restrictions
* Recursive deletion in database between tests
* User Jakarta Commons EqualsBuilder and HashCodeBuilder in entities
